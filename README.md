Calculator Project
Overview
The Calculator Project is a user-friendly web application built with React. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, utilize memory functions, and evaluate complex mathematical expressions.

Features
Basic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Memory Functions:
M+
M-
MR
MC
Advanced Calculations:
Square root
Percentage
Calculation History:
Maintains a history of past calculations.
Error Handling:
Manages invalid inputs and operations effectively.
Technologies Used
React: Selected for building a dynamic user interface.
TypeScript: Provides type safety, improving code maintainability.
Material-UI (MUI): Used for modern component styling.
BigNumber.js: Ensures precision in arithmetic operations, especially for large and floating-point numbers.
SCSS Modules: Facilitates modular and maintainable styling.
How to Run the Project Locally
Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 14 or later.
Package Manager: Either npm or yarn.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
