Calculator Project
Overview
This is a simple calculator application built with React that supports basic arithmetic operations, memory functions, and evaluates complex mathematical expressions using the Shunting Yard algorithm.

Features
Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Memory functions: M+, M-, MR, MC
Square root and percentage calculations
History of calculations
Error handling for invalid inputs and operations
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: For type safety and better development experience.
MUI (Material-UI): For styling components.
BigNumber.js: For precise arithmetic operations, particularly with large and floating-point numbers.
SCSS Modules: For modular and maintainable styling.
How to Run the Project Locally
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm or yarn
Steps
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd calculator
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running Tests
To run the unit tests for the calculator functions, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
# or
yarn test
Edge Cases Handled
Division by Zero: An error is thrown when attempting to divide by zero, preventing the application from crashing.
Invalid Expressions: The application checks for malformed expressions and displays an appropriate error message.
Square Root of Negative Numbers: An error message is displayed when trying to calculate the square root of a negative number.
Potential Improvements
Implement additional mathematical functions such as exponentiation, logarithms, or trigonometric functions.
Enhance the user interface with more advanced styling and animations.
Add a feature for saving and retrieving previous calculations.
Improve error handling and user feedback for invalid inputs.
Tools and Libraries
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easy to manage UI state.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors, improving development efficiency.
MUI: Provides a robust component library for building responsive user interfaces quickly.
BigNumber.js: Ideal for handling large numbers and ensuring precision in arithmetic operations, especially important in financial calculations. 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
