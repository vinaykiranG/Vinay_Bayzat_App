Calculator Project

Overview
A simple calculator application built with React, supporting basic arithmetic operations, memory functions, and evaluation of complex mathematical expressions.

How to Run the Project Locally
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
Start the development server to view the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Running Tests
Use the test command to execute unit tests for the calculator functions.
Edge Cases Handled
Division by Zero: Displays an error message instead of crashing the application.
Invalid Expressions: The app checks for malformed inputs and shows appropriate error messages.
Square Root of Negative Numbers: Provides feedback when attempting to calculate the square root of a negative number.
Potential Improvements
Implement advanced mathematical functions (e.g., exponentiation, logarithms).
Enhance the user interface with better styling and animations.
Add features for saving and retrieving previous calculations.
Improve user feedback for invalid inputs.
Tools and Libraries Used
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling easy state management.
TypeScript: Provides type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving development efficiency.
Material-UI (MUI): Offers a robust library for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
BigNumber.js: Ensures precision in arithmetic operations, especially important for financial calculations.
